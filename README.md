# Automated Detection of Areca Nut Leaf Diseases

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting diseases in Areca nut leaves using AI/ML techniques. By leveraging the Inspection v3 model and deploying a Flask web application, we have created an efficient and accurate tool to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying leaf diseases early.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 95% accuracy in detecting various diseases in Areca nut leaves.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web application built using Flask for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Quick processing and immediate results for uploaded images.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to detect other types of plant diseases.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Model**: Inspection v3
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arecanut-leaf-disease-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd arecanut-leaf-disease-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Upload an image of an Areca nut leaf.
3. Click on the "Detect Disease" button to get the result.

## Results

The system provides a detailed report on the detected disease, including the type of disease and suggestions for treatment. With a high accuracy rate, this tool is reliable for real-time disease detection and management.
